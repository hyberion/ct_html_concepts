# Coding Temple HTML Concepts
####An experiment in time management

So this is (roughly) the requested HTML file.  Regretfully it has come up when I am suddenly slameed between two very involved projects (both involving some heavy duty development).

So, the end result is that I didn't hand-code this file.  I built it using a development app I'm using on these projects.  I tried to hand code it, but a) I haven't handwritten HTML in twenty years
and every time I tried, my ADHD and obsessive nature would flare up, and I'd spend a day kicking on it, getting caught up in trying to work out if I should add a modal to the buttons or have the
form submit for real (and then got sick for three days), and suddenly, a week was gone.

So, in the interest of progress, I hammered this out and have uploaded it.
Forgive my use of a tool. I can actually hand code HTML, but I just didn't have time.

If it *has* to be hand coded, I'll do it over.

I don't know if valid Bootstrap counts as an extra but I did set that up.

Again, apologies.
And a cry for your pity.
Thanks
